                    <p>Hello, My name is Justine and I am now 27 years old. I enrolled in the CART program in Fall 17 and I have now 9 credit left to graduate (including this class). My studies have been interrupted by me living in Australia for a few months. Being there officialized my love for nature. I had to come back because of COVID which ended in a heartbreak.
                        At my return, I reunited with my cat ‘Internet’ and adopted a dog ‘Spy’. They both get along well and they make the biggest portion of my personality, sadly.</p>
                    <p>Otherwise, me and my closest friends got a land together, which I consider my ultimate favorite project. For now, we are camping and swimming. We bought a pedal boat which I am very proud of, for some reasons. </p>
                    <p>The more I grow up, the less fear I have to be boring. I love simple.</p>
