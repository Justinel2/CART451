                        <p>Hello, My name is Justine and I am now 27 years old. I enrolled in the CART program in Fall 17 and I have now 9 credit left to graduate (including this class). My studies have been interrupted by me living in Australia for a few months. Being there officialized my love for nature. I had to come back because of COVID which ended in a heartbreak.
                            At my return, I reunited with my cat ‘Internet’ and adopted a dog ‘Spy’. They both get along well and they make the biggest portion of my personality, sadly.</p>
                        <p>Otherwise, me and my closest friends got a land together, which I consider my ultimate favorite project. For now, we are camping and swimming. We bought a pedal boat which I am very proud of, for some reasons. </p>
                        <p>The more I grow up, the less fear I have to be boring. I love simple.</p>

                <p>&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;In her month-long experiment social turkers: crowdsourced dating (2013), Lauren McCarthy developed a system of live feedback on her OkCupid dates. The dates were streamed through an IPhone app and Amazon Mechanical Turk workers would be allowed to see the interactions in real time, interpret and offer feedback about McCarthy’s next moves by text message. This is one of the technologies discussed in Jeff Howe’s article “The Rise of Crowdsourcing” (2003):</p> 
                <p class="long-citation">Peter Cohen, the program's director, acknowledges that Mechanical Turk, launched in beta in November, is a work in progress. (Amazon refuses to give a date for its official launch.) "This is a very new idea, and it's going to take some time for people to wrap their heads around it," Cohen says. "We're at the tippy-top of the iceberg."</p>
                <p>&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;Ten years later, the crowdsourcing marketplace is still alive and used by many, such as artists like McCarthy. As stated in Howe’s article, this engine helps match a human to accomplish certain tasks: “Amazon calls the tasks HITs (human intelligence tasks); they're designed to require very little time, and consequently they offer very little compensation—most from a few cents to a few dollars.” Indeed, McCarthy made sure to denote the prices she was offered for each different task in her project journal logs. At some point, she increases the price she was offering: “It seems that $0.20 wasn’t enough, I think $0.25 is a sort of cut off when workers are searching for jobs.” Despite the increase, it shows how cheap the cost is if we compare it to subcontracting subjects to do the same tasks outside the crowdsourcing platform. According to Howe, crowdsourcing is in fact a good deal for entities that “can turn to the crowd to help curb the rising cost of corporate research.” In that sense, McCarthy’s experiment did not need big funding and costs, so was possibly able to conduct this project because of the low costs. This does in fact relate to how companies have been looking overseas for cheap labor in the past decades.</p>
                <p>&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;With the accessibility and the  immediacy of the internet, she was also able to get responses in real-time to affect the course of her date according to the feedback she would get from the Turkers. If not bots, the workers watching the artist may be from any location and any socioeconomic group. They also have different skill sets which could potentially mean a stronger network of subjects according to Howe: “The most efficient networks are those that link to the broadest range of information, knowledge, and experience.” In regards to her project, McCarthy stated that: “Oddly, knowing that the workers are watching me made me feel a sense of reassurance, like I’m not all alone in this situation.” Her life has now become content to be broadcasted, judged and controlled by a crowd. It does feel similar to the reality TV format that has been increasingly popular in the last decades. In this case, the viewers are also manipulating the content by deciding on the next actions of the artist. This format relates directly to the concept of user-generated TV discussed in Howe’s article: "I can imagine a time when all of our shows will have a user-generated component." In fact, the artist is able to be a producer and a broadcaster with only her personal phone, while the Turkers are content creators and directors.</p>

                <p class="response-title">Experiential Data Visualization</p>
                <p class="subtitle-response">Weekly response #3, Due Week 6 (October 18, 2022)</p>
                
                <p>&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;In their paper “We Feel Fine and Searching the Emotional Web”, Sepandar D. Kamvar and Jonathan Harris discuss <span class=italicized>We Feel Fine</span>, their data-driven project launched in 2006. Their “emotional engine and web-based artwork has been accumulating millions of feelings by scraping social media posts mentioning feelings across different platforms (MIT Docubase). Then, this data is organized and displayed on their website in seven different forms, giving different experiences regarding data-visualization (Sepandar et Harris 2011, 121).</p> 
                <p>&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;Through their user experience study, they categorized their data-visualization project as ‘Experiential Data Visualization’, which they defined briefly: Visualizations of this type would share three properties: first, they would communicate insights that are often simply communicated in words, but much more powerfully communicated by example; second, they would focus on interaction models that encourage direct interaction with individual data items; and third, they would focus on influencing affect rather than cognition. (125)” </p>
                <p>&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;Through my own exploration, I will compare the project to <span class=italicized>Quantified Self</span>, an international community of users and makers of self-tracking tools. Again, these projects will be discussed briefly around the three properties enunciated by Kamvar and Harris’ paper. </p>        
                <p>&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;Firstly, experiential data visualization communicates data that is much more powerfully understood by example, rather than words. Kamvar and Harris’ suggest that  <span class=italicized>We Feel Fine</span>’s design principles are emulating a guide for this type of data visualization: “...one may argue that you don’t need an interactive data visualization to communicate that you are not alone in your emotions. However, that is more powerfully expressed by showing the emotions of others, in the same way that lessons about love are often easily expressed in words, but more powerfully learned by actually being in love.” (125) The <span class=italicized>Quantified Self</span> website does exactly that, by allowing individuals to present a picture of their own data, to better understand them: “We define <span class=italicized>Quantified Self</span> as this practice of making self-initiated observations for the purpose of personal discovery.” (Quantified Self n.d.c)</p> 
                <p>&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;Secondly,  <span class=italicized>We Feel Fine</span> allows users to interact with individual data from their seven display forms: “In shifting from micro to macro, the user can better understand trends exposed through summarization. And in shifting from micro to macro, the user can generalize intuitions gained from browsing.” (Sepandar et Harris 2011, 118)  On the other hand, the <span class=italicized>Quantified Self</span> project does not clearly instruct participants in ways to design more efficiently their data collections. In their “Get Started” guide, their instructions cover mostly data collection and conclusion, but not data visualization (Quantified Self n.d.a). They do have a “Project Log” forum page so participants can get feedback from their peers (Quantified Self, n.d.b). However, I do believe that instruction about better practices for displaying data should be included in the website. Also, it would be interesting for them to host some willing participants' data visualizations, because only presentations of data seem available on their website.</p> 
                <p>&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;Thirdly, both projects demonstrated their significant influence on viewers' affects. In  <span class=italicized>We Feel Fine</span>, their user study established that two of their seven data visualization designs were more likely to instigate feelings to their users: “...their post-study observations were more likely to be along the lines of ‘It really changed my mood which was surprising’...” (Sepandar et Harris 2011, 125) For the <span class=italicized>Quantified Self</span> project, the ability of the users to view their own data can influence changes in affects. In a study led by Melanie Swan, quantified self tools “are becoming a node in the landscape, offering an effective mix of quantified self-tracking data collection tools, lightweight social networking interaction, and gamification rewards, all of which combine to influence behavior change.” (Swan 2012, 99) One presentation at a QS conference is Nancy Dougherty’s Technology for Mindfulness. In her presentation, she discusses her project; a smile-triggered electromyogram (EMG) muscle sensor with a light emitting diode (LED) headband display. She wore this wearable during the span of a week. Everytime she smiled, a cascade of LED lights would be triggered to engage with her and also people around her. So, the project was designed to create unexpected moments of joy in human interactions, responding to the third property of experiential data visualization stated by Kamvar and Harris (Dougherty 2012, 10:30). </p> 
                <p class="long-citation">But when I was tracking emotions it was completely different; it was a whole new phenomenon. Because just by tracking my emotions I was able to stabilize them better. My moods were much more stable. I could prevent myself from spiraling into negative emotions. I was no longer a victim to my mindset, just to this awareness that was required through self-tracking. (Dougherty 2012, 3:25)</p>
